                        <p><em>Michelangelo was a triple threat: A painter (the Sistine Ceiling), a sculptor (the David
                                and Pietà) and architect (St. Peter's Basilica in Rome). Make that a quadruple threat
                                since he also wrote poetry. </em></p>

                                best known of Michelangelo's works today, but the artist thought of himself primarily as

                        <p>The Spanish born artist had become the most well-known name in modern art, with the most
                            distinct style and eye for artistic creation. There had been no other artists, prior to
                            Picasso, who had such an impact on the art world, or had a mass following of fans and
                            critics alike, as he did.</p>

                            most parodied portrait and religious painting of all time</p>
