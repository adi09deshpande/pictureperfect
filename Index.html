    <p class="para-1">Art is a creative activity that expresses imaginative or technical skill. It produces a product,
        an object. Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, performing artifacts, and expressing
        the authors imaginative mind. The product of art is called a work of art, for others to experience
        Some art is useful in a practical sense, such as a sculptured clay bowl that can be used. That kind of art is
        sometimes called a craft.

        Those who make art are called artists. They hope to affect the emotions of people who experience it. Some people
        find art relaxing, exciting or informative. Some say people are driven to make art due to their inner
        creativity.

        "The arts" is a much broader term. It includes drawing, painting, sculpting, photography, performance art,
        dance, music, poetry, prose and theatre.

        Art is divided into the plastic arts(where something is made),the performing arts(where something is done by
        humans in action) Pure arts(done for themselves) and practical arts(done for a practical purpose but with
        artistic content)<br><br>

        1.<u>Plastic art</u><br><br>
        -Fine art is expression by making something beautiful or appealing to the emotions by visual means: drawing,
        painting, printmaking, sculpture<br>
        -Literature: poetry, creative writing<br><br>
        2..<u>Performing art</u><br><br>
        -Performing art including drama are (expression using the body: dance, acting, singing)<br>
        -Auditory art (expression by making sounds): music, singing<br><br>
        3.<u>Practical art</u><br><br>
        -Culinary art (expression by making flavors and tastes): cooking<br>
        -The practical arts (expression by making things and structures: architecture, filming, fashion, photography,
        video games)<br>

    <p class="para-2"> Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light,
        either
        electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as
        photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and
        business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby,
        and mass communication.
        Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-
        sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an e
        lectrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subseq
        uent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later
        chemically
        "developed" into a visible image, either negative or positive, depending on the purpose of the photographic
        material
        and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create
        a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.
