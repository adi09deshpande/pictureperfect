    <p class="para-1">A simple definition of photography is that it is the process of capturing light with a device
        known as a camera and creating an image. That camera could come in various forms by a modern interpretation,
        including cell phone cameras, digital cameras, and traditional analog cameras. <br><br>
        <span class="titlem">What Is the Purpose of Photography? </span><br><br>
        Photography can serve many purposes and have many facets. Photography can tell a story, it can capture a moment
        in time, it can document, and it can be art. There are many technical uses for photography as well as social and
        creative ones. How we use and interact with photography is highly personal and will differ from one person to
        the next.<br><br>
        <span class="titlem">Is Photography an Art?</span><br><br>
        Photography can be an art form, but not all photographs are created to be artworks or as forms of artistic
        expression. It took time for photography to be truly recognized as a valid art form. However, in the present
        day, many art museums and art galleries now exhibit photographic artworks.<br>

        1.Finding a strong focal point is one of the fundamental steps of how to take professional photos.
        So when you’re planning out or setting up a shot, you should stop and ask yourself, “What do I want
        viewers to focus on?”<br><br>
        2.Instead of positioning the focal point in the center of your shot, it can make for a more interesting
        composition
        if you follow the rule of thirds. This rule states that you should place the most important elements in your
        photos
        off center<br><br>
        3.Use Leading Lines,<br>
        Leading lines are line shapes in your shot that can help guide a viewer’s eyes to the focal point. They can be
        anything
        that creates a line in your photo, like roads, fences, buildings, long hallways, trees, or shadows.<br>
        Perspective has a massive impact on the composition of any photo. By simply changing the angle or distance you
        shoot
        from, you can totally change the mood and meaning of your images.<br>
        Finding ways to convey depth is another important step in learning how to take professional photos. If you
        ignore this
        rule, your photos can end up feeling very flat and boring
